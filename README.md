# ALQRsimulations
R code with software for performing assumption-lean quantile regression, as proposed in the paper "Assumption-Lean Quantile Regression" by Baklicharov et al. 
The code contains the simulation studies reported in that paper.

Different R files correspond to different simulation experiments:
  - ALQR_QRF_binary: simulations where the exposure is binary and quantiles are estimated using Quantile Regression Forests.
  - ALQR_QRF_continuous: simulations where the exposure is continuous and quantiles are estimated using Quantile Regression Forests.
  - ALQR_varSelection: simulations of experiment 4.
