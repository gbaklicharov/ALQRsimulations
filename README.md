# ALQRsimulations
R code with software for performing assumption-lean quantile regression, as proposed in the paper "Assumption-Lean Quantile Regression" by Baklicharov, Ley and Vansteelandt. 
The code contains the simulation studies reported in that paper.

Different R files correspond to different simulation experiments.
